##Here, we must use the -a option mentioned in Level 0 -> 1 alongside the ls command if we 
want to see the 'inhere' directory and the and the ...Hiding-From-You file. You would still be
able to run the file regardless, but to avoid confusion further down the line, do build familiarity 
with this command.
