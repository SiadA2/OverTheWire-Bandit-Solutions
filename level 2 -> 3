##Here, we run into the same problem as before, with the terminal not correctly reading the filename, from lines 18
to 23. However, instead of the terminal expecting standard input, we get the error message "cat: unrecognized option '--spaces'".
This is because the dash at the start causes the terminal to read this as an option for the cat command, however, as you'll know, 
'spaces in this filename', isn't a valid option when using the cat command (see man<command>), which triggers the subsequent error message. 
This means that in order for the filename to be read correctly, we must again prefix the filename with './'.

##Additionally, if we were to input the filename without quotation marks, we would get the error message 'no such file or directory'. This is because 
the filename contains spaces, so without "", the terminal will read this as sperate files, causing the error message to appear as they wouldn't
have been created yet. To avoid this, we envelope the filename between quotation marks.
