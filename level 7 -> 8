##The 'vim' command allows you to edit text ('vi' can be used to). It takes you to a page 
containing all the text for the file which can be edited by pressing 'i' on the keyboard. 
However, instead of this, we'll use the '/' which allows us to look for specific characters in 
the file. Once we do this, we can toggle between each instance of said character(s) using either 
N or n, however, we won't need it for this level since the word we are looking for only occurs once.
