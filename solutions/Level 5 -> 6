##Despite the fact that the description explains that the file must be human-readable and 
not-executable as well as 1033 bytes in size, the file on line 17 is the only file in the 'inhere'
directory that is 1033 bytes, so we can assume that it will fit the other two criteria. 
Because of this, this may not be the best solution for this level and would recommend some 
extra research to find a better one.
