##The ls command with the option -a tells the terminal to show all files and directories, including hidden ones.

##Here you can also see in lines 20 and 22 that there was no output for each cat command. This because the terminal didn't
recognise this as a file and hence now expects standard input from the user, explaining the gaps. To avoid this, we prefix the file with './' to
specify to the terminal that this is a file. We can now see that terminal now behaves as expected, printing the contents of the 
'-' file.
