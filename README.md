# OverTheWire-Bandit-Solutions

This is a repo which containes solutions from the online game 'OverTheWire Bandit'. It's a game designed to enhance confidence in using the Linux command line and it really puts your Linux navigation skills to the test through a series of upto 34 levels, each being a complex problem requiring a mix of problem solving as well as good awareness of the different commands used in Linux. In this repo, I have designed each solution to be as helpful and readable as possible by meticulous annotation coupled with an accurate representation of what you would see in the terminal as you type in the commands. Lastly, I would strongly recommend that you visit this repo after having attempted the challenges and that you use these solutions as guidance and learning rather that memorising the commands. Enjoy!
